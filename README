Note: env setup requires slightly more than a normal Android build,
so that the path gets adjusted for tradefed.sh:

From the root of your Android tree:

. build/envsetup.sh
. build/make/envsetup.sh
lunch 2				# generic aosp arm64 eng build
mmma tools/tradefederation/core tools/test/graphicsbenchmark

Incremental build + run, from tools/test/graphicsbenchmark dir:

mma
tradefed.sh run commandAndExit AndroidTest.xml --alt-dir $OUT --apk-dir $OUT/data/app

Contact a member of the team for alternative test apks.
