Ensure that `adb` and `aapt` are available on your path and run:
$ ./run_gamecore.sh <options>

Available options include:
--apk-info  An XML file describing the list of APKs for qualifications.
--apk-dir   Directory contains the APKs for qualifications.  If --apk-info is not specified and a
file named 'apk-info.xml' exists in --apk-dir, that file will be used as the apk-info.
